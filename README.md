puppet-rsnapshot

Introduction
------------

[puppet-rsnapshot](http://redmine.the.re/projects/puppet-rsnapshot "puppet rsnapshot module") is a [rsnapshot](http://www.rsnapshot.org/ "rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility for making backups of local and remote systems") puppet module. It is based on the following assumptions:

* All machines have rsync over ssh
* All backups consist of the entire file system of the machine
* It takes less than two hours to backup all machines

If this does not match the intended usage pattern, it may be better to consider an alternative. 

A ssh key is created on the puppet master ( by the *rsnapshot::puppetmaster* class ) and installed in the root authorized_keys file of each machines to be backuped ( by the *rsnapshot::client* class ). The machine running *rsnapshot* has one configuration file per client ( generated by the *rsnapshot::server* class ). It runs each backup in sequence, starting in the middle of the night. The health of the backups can be monitored by nagios  using a [nagios plugin](http://redmine.the.re/projects/puppet-rsnapshot/repository/revisions/master/entry/files/check_rsnapshot "nagios plugin for puppet-rsnapshot") ( installed by the *rsnapshot::nagios* class ). 

Usage
-----

*puppet-rsnapshot* is a puppet module that should be installed in the puppet master as follows

    git clone http://redmine.the.re/git/puppet-rsnapshot.git /etc/puppet/modules/rsnapshot
    
or

    puppet module install loic/rsnapshot
    
Here is an example usage of the module extracted from a manifest:

    node 'bm0001.the.re' {
      class { 'rsnapshot::puppetmaster': }
      class { 'rsnapshot::client':
        excludes => [ '/var/lib/glance',
                      '/var/lib/nova',
                      '/media/turnkey', ]
      }
    }
    
    node 'rsnapshot.novalocal' {
      class { 'rsnapshot::server':
        ip => "5.9.88.172,${::ipaddress}",
      }
    }
    
    node 'jenkins.novalocal', 'redmine.novalocal', 'there.novalocal' {
      class { 'rsnapshot::client':
        ip => $::ipaddress,
      }
    }
    
    node 'debian.novalocal' {
      class { 'rsnapshot::client':
        ip => $::ipaddress,
        excludes => [ '/media/debian' ],
      }
    }
    node 'nagios.novalocal' {
      class { 'rsnapshot::nagios: }
    }
